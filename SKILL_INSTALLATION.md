# App Store Submission Skill - Global Installation

✅ **Skill has been installed globally!**

The App Store submission skill is now available in **all your projects** at:
```
~/.cursor/skills/app-store-submission/
```

## What This Means

The AI agent will now automatically help with App Store submissions in **any iOS project** you work on. You don't need to copy anything - the skill is available globally.

## How to Use

### In Any New Project

Simply ask the AI:
- "Help me submit this app to the App Store"
- "What do I need to do for App Store submission?"
- "Check my Info.plist for App Store requirements"
- "Resize my screenshots for App Store Connect"

The AI will automatically use the skill and guide you through the process.

## What the Skill Knows

- ✅ Export compliance requirements
- ✅ Screenshot dimension requirements
- ✅ App Store Connect metadata rules (no emojis!)
- ✅ Common pitfalls and solutions
- ✅ Step-by-step workflows
- ✅ Automation script locations

## Project-Specific Resources

While the skill is global, you may still want to copy these to each project:

### Essential (Recommended)
- `scripts/` directory - Automation scripts
- `APP_STORE_SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` - Reusable checklist
- `QUICK_START_SUBMISSION.md` - Quick reference

### Optional
- `APP_STORE_DESCRIPTION.md` - Metadata template (customize per app)
- `LEARNINGS.md` - Reference document

## Verification

To verify the skill is installed:
```bash
ls ~/.cursor/skills/app-store-submission/
```

You should see `SKILL.md` in that directory.

## Updating the Skill

If you learn new things from future submissions:
1. Edit `~/.cursor/skills/app-store-submission/SKILL.md`
2. Add new learnings to the skill
3. All future projects will benefit automatically
